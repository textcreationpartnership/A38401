            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>His Majesties Cauſe of this Warre is either juſt or unjuſt, or dubious, <hi>viz.</hi> partly juſt, and partly unjuſt.</head>
            <p n="1">1. WE will firſt ſuppoſe his Majeſties Cauſe to be juſt, that he has onely the defenſive part, and is neceſſitated to fight; and that the Parliament, as yet, hath offered no termes of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation to him, but ſuch as are more unjuſt then all the plagues of this calamitous warre.</p>
            <p>This ſo being ſuppoſed, makes him innocent, but yet moſt unfortunate; it makes him the firſt man that ever fortune pict out to ingage in ſuch a wretched de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of men and treaſure without blame; amongſt all his Anceſtors, there will not appeare upon ſearch one of them who was juſt, and maintained a juſt cauſe, and yet met with ſuch generall oppoſition from his Subjects, much leſſe from the Lords and Commons aſſembled in a Parliament.</p>
            <p>How triviall ſoever the Kings ſide accounts this, there was not ever a worſe prodigie in the World to amaze any State, then this is, if it be true, that the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly repreſentative body of this nation, has, cauſleſly and unnaturally, riſen up againſt their righteous King to purſue him ſo farre as ours now is.</p>
            <p>It is not to be denied, but that ſome Parliaments have done ſome unjuſt things, when they have beene wrought upon by the force and fraud of Princes; but no Example can be ſhewed, that ever any Parliament did ſuch an unjuſt thing as this, contrary to all motives and influences of a gracious and religious Prince.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:54381:3"/>
            <p>Some of the Kings party have argued thus; If Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments may erre when they are perfect, having the concurrence of the royall State with them, much more may they erre when the royall State recedes from them, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But this I hold a grand miſtake; for if I have any reaſon to make a right uſe of ſtory, Parliaments are repeſented to me never leſſe liable to error, then when they receive leaſt impreſſions from the King. With what regret then ought the King to look upon this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precedented diſaſter? Certainly if he looke upon us with a naturall eye, under ſuch unparalleled ſufferings, or upon himſelfe with a pious eye vnder ſuch an une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall affliction, it cannot but adminiſter thoughts of honour to him; <hi>bonus pastor ponit vitam pro ovilius,</hi> ſo ſaid that Prince of Peace in whom onely there was no ſinne, and in whoſe flocke joyntly and ſeverally taken there was nothing elſe but ſinne; and yet his death ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led as much as his mouth affirmed. <hi>Moſes</hi> ſeemed to preferre the welfare of the obſtinate Jewes, not onely before all his temporall intereſts, but alſo before his eternall diadem in Heaven; and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſeemed to be rapt up with a ſpecies of the ſame Zeale.</p>
            <p>The paſſions of ſome heathen and hereticall Princes towards their leige Subjects have beene almoſt above the pitch of humanity: With what a wrange kind of hypochondriacall frenzie did <hi>Augustus Caeſar</hi> cry out, <hi>Redde mihi Legiones vare?</hi> If the blood of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects had been drawne forcibly out of his owne deereſt Veins, it could not have parted from him with a ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger reſentment. How did our Queene <hi>Mary</hi> even to to the death, deplore the loſſe of one Towne in <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cardie?</hi> With what ſtrange Inſtruments did griefe make inciſſion in her heart, whilſt it would ingrave the
<pb facs="tcp:54381:3"/>name of <hi>Callice</hi> there?</p>
            <p>The loſſe of all Kings in all wars uſes to be very do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorous: but native Kings in civill Warres when they looke upon ſuch vaſt deſolation, as is now to be ſeene in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> muſt needs thinke that their owne intereſt, their owne honour, their owne ſafety, is of leſſe conſequence.</p>
            <p n="2">2 We will now ſuppoſe the Kings Cauſe to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, that the Parliament has had none but loyall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions towards him and his royall Dignity, nor has attempted any thing but to defend Religion againſt the Papiſts, the Lawes of the Land againſt Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents, and the Priviledges of both Houſes againſt Malignants; and on the contrary we will ſuppoſe, that that private Counſell which the King has follwed ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then his publike owne, has aimed at the Arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry rule of <hi>France,</hi> and to effect the ſame has counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced Popery, and but pretended danger from the Parliament, from the City of <hi>London,</hi> and from the beſt affected of the whole Kingdome: <hi>Qui ſupponit non ponit:</hi> We will not aſſume, but preſume onely, that the great Counſell of the Land is in the right ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then the King and his claudeſtine Counſell; but ſee what will follow upon this ſuppoſition, if it prove to be true, as it is neither impoſſible nor improbable; if this be true, what a formidable day is that to be wherein the King ſhall render a ſtrict account for all the Engliſh Proteſtant blood which has beene iſſued out, and is to be yet iſſued out in this wicked and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall quarrell? <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> which filled <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> with blood, and made the Channels thereof flow with the pretious blood of Saints, could not contract ſo blacke a guilt, as he that imbrewes two large King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes with blood, and that with the blood of the beſt
<pb facs="tcp:54381:4"/>reformed Profeſſors of our Saviours Goſpell. That blood of Proteſtants which has beene ſhed by Papiſts, as in the <hi>Pariſian</hi> Maſſacree; that blood of Chriſtians which has beene ſhed by Infidels, as in <hi>Turkey;</hi> that blood of Saints which has beene ſhed by Hereticks, as in the <hi>Arian</hi> Emperours dayes; that blood of ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers which has beene ſhed by conquering Uſurpers, as in <hi>Peru</hi> of late, may admit of ſome colour or excuſe as to ſome degree of hainouſneſſe, and may plead for ſome kind of Expiation; but this is beyond all thought or expreſſion.</p>
            <p>The goodly Kingdome of <hi>Ireland</hi> is almoſt conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into a <hi>Golgotha,</hi> and the more goodly Kingdome of <hi>England</hi> is haſting to a worſe point of deſolation. It muſt needs be therefore, that he to whoſe cruelty and injuſtice ſo much confuſion ſhall be imputed, muſt be perpetually abominated as a plague of humane kind, more monſtrous and portentuous, then any age for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly had the ſtrength to produce. The ripping up of a Mothers wombe, the fiting of ſuch a Metropolis as <hi>Rome</hi> was, were but ſtraines of vulgar narrow-hearted cruelty; <hi>Antichriſt</hi> himſelfe may owne the depopula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and vaſtation of our Brittiſh Iſlands, as acts wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of his dying fury.</p>
            <p n="3">3 But it remaines now in the laſt place, that we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſome doubt to be in the Caſe, or ſome mixture of injuſtice in ſome circumſtances: as that though the King incline not at all to Popery himſelfe, yet he has favoured and enabled Papiſts too far to doe miſchiefe; and though he cannot with ſafety caſt himſelfe wholly upon the fidelity of the Parliament, yet he has no cauſe utterly to reject their conſent, and approbation in the filling up of all places of publike power and truſt as the emergent neceſſity of the times now is, nor
<pb facs="tcp:54381:4"/>to perſiſt in this al-conſuming war rather then to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcend to an Accommodation; if we lay downe this for ſuppoſed, we muſt needs conclude that the King has not punctually, and duly diſcharged his Office, ſo as that he can cleerly acquit and abſolve himſelfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God of this lamentable effuſion of Chriſtian blood; for there muſt not onely be a perſpicuous ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice in the Cauſe, but an abſolute neceſſity of the war when Kings take up the ſword againſt ſuch a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable number of their Subjects, as our King now fights againſt.</p>
            <p>Though the Cauſe may be juſt, yet the warre is not lawfull where the miſerable conſequences of it do too farre out-ballance the iniquity of the conditions offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and propoſed by the aſſailed party. Wherefore, if the meere and cleere juſtice of a Cauſe cannot alwaies wipe off guilt, how ſhall he be purged from offence whoſe Cauſe is not totally juſt, nor undeniably evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in a warre of this nature? If the King does not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parantly fight for <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> yet 'tis moſt apparent that <hi>Antichriſt</hi> does fight for the King; the whole Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchy has declared their ingagement by publiſhing Buls and by ſending ſupplies into <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>England</hi> out of ſeverall Popiſh Countries.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide, if the Earle of <hi>Eſſex</hi> does not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently fight for Chriſt, yet it ſeemes very probable that Chriſt fights for him; for our great Armies with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Circle of the laſt yeere have foure times met, and ſtill the King, ſide hath gone off with loſſe and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage. <hi>Redding</hi> being begirt with his Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies Forces, all his Majeſties power could not relieve it; yet <hi>Gloucester</hi> being begirt by his Majeſties For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, his Excellency found meanes to relieve it. And as for <hi>Edge-hill</hi> and <hi>Newbery,</hi> though neither ſide was
<pb facs="tcp:54381:5"/>totally routed, yet the maſtery of the field was left to his Excellency; and had not fraud done better ſervice to the King then force, ſcarce any other encounters in other parts had bin proſperous to his Popiſh Armies.</p>
            <p>Theſe things ſeeme to make the Kings Cauſe at leſt dubious, for it were ſtrange if in theſe latter dayes Chriſt and Antichriſt ſhould be ſo farre reconciled in any one Cauſe, as to unite their battels in the ſame Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition, or to pitch their Tents in the ſame field; and grant any doubt in this Caſe, and the King can never be capable of juſtification in proſecuting it ſo far with fire and ſword; for the King has already ſworn to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold and preſerve in their intire vigor the Laws of the Land, and the Priviledges of Parliament; and we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deny, but even this doubt might be decided by the Lawes in Parliament, or by ſome other Judicatory out of Parliament, if the King would referre it to ſuch a deciſion, if the King will admit of no Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatory to determine this matter, what are all our Lawes and Priviledges worth? If he will admit of one but doubts what it is, and will not be reſolved by his Parliament in that doubt, what will all his oathes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit us? what will all his deepe profeſſions of favour to our Lawes and Priviledges ſtand us in ſtead? Nay, when the King is not certaine of victory, and yet hath by ſo many dreadfull oathes debarred himſelf from ill advantages by victory, if this devouring war (wherein ſo much loſſe is, and no gaine at all to countervaile it) be ſtill protracted, and preferred before a juſt Peace, all theſe inexpiable miſchiefes will be charged upon him, and future ages muſt needs ſuſpect, that love of ruine and deſtruction, and a perfect hatred to the very nature and being of man, was the execrable cauſe of it.</p>
